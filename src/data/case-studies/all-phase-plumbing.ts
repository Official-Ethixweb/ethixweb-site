// Every fact below (client, industry, the WordPress -> custom-build move, the
// Google Cloud hosting) is real, sourced from the approved case-study
// design. Two spots in that design left bracketed placeholders the designer
// never filled in (a "[Insert name] + [Insert name] + [Insert name]" stack
// list and an "[X]s to [X]s" load-time claim) - rather than invent specific
// framework names or numbers we can't verify, those were generalized to
// statements the surrounding copy already supports. Swap in the real specs
// here once they're confirmed; nothing else about the page needs to change.
