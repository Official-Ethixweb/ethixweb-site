 * the soft "halo" (transmission-material edge glow) starting only ~2px further
 * out - too close for any fixed crop to clear the halo without clipping the
 * letter at that same angle. Fixed by moving the scene's own camera back
 * (`public/emblem-3d.html`'s `ri.position.set(...)`, 1.5x its original
 * distance) so the model occupies far less of the raw frame at every angle
 * (worst case dropped to 61.0% of frame) - the crop's safety margin no longer
 * has to be fought for pixel-by-pixel. `EMBLEM_3D_BASE_SCALE` is then scaled
 * up by the resulting shrink (measured via a front-on bbox before/after the

 * comfortable, vs. the ~0.1-point margin that made clipping unavoidable
 * before the dolly. Raising WINDOW_GROWTH alone (no change to BASE_SCALE)
 * only grows the crop margin - it cancels out of the letter's own on-screen

 * haloed on the other) once real devices were involved. Fix: always render
 * the 3D scene at this fixed, generous resolution regardless of device, then
